# Virtual World - Following Radu Mariescu-Istodor's Tutorial

This project is based on the **"Self-Driving Car :: Phase 2"** course by [Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfZtY5IQl1aNwcoOPJNtnPEO). It focuses on creating a dynamic virtual environment from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with features like spatial graphs, road borders, buildings, and a minimap. This serves as a foundation for advanced self-driving car and AI simulations.

Follow along with the original tutorial playlist for in-depth guidance and learning.
